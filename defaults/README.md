# Defaults

This directory contains configurations for specific experiment types or platforms with default metrics and statistics that are computed for every experiment.

Changes to these configurations require approval on a pull request.
Once merged, live experiments will get rerun so the new configurations can get applied. Experiments that have been completed in the past **will not be rerun automatically**, manual reruns need to be triggered if necessary.

Avoid making changes to existing metrics, as results might become inconsistent with experiment analysis results computed in the past.
